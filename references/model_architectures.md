#### Key model architectures and terms:
-   Supervised training (full dataset)
    -   baseline: downloaded the pre-trained the models and evaluate without finetuning.
-   Supervised training (1k dataset)
    -   Supervised: original ResNet50 used by Sen12ms
    -   Supervised_1x1: adding conv1x1 block to the ResNet50 used by Sen12ms
-   Finetune/transfer learning (1k dataset)
    -   Moco: the ResNet50 used by Sen12ms is initialized with the weight from Moco backbone
    -   Moco_1x1: adding conv1x1 block to the ResNet50 used by Sen12ms and both input module and ResNet50 layers are initialized with the weight from Moco
    -   Moco_1x1Rnd: adding conv1x1 block to the ResNet50 used by Sen12ms. ResNet50 layers are initialized with the weight from Moco but input module is initialized with random weights
-   Finetune v2 (1k dataset)
    -   freezing ResNet50 fully or partially does not seem to help with accuracy. We will continue explore and share the results once we are sure there is no issue with implementation.
